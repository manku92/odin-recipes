  <p>This <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12477/steak-and-kidney-pie-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steak and kidney pie</a> is a meal in itself! Perfectly seasoned beed and potatoes simmer beneath a flaky crust for a comforting, hearty old-fashioned pie. I like to use milder flavored lamb kidneys instead of beef.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound fresh lamb kidneys</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter or lard</li>
    <li>2 pounds round steak, cubed</li>
    <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Worcesterhire sauce</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>2 cups water, divided</li>
    <li>4 cups diced potatoes</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Remove fat and membrance from the kidneys; cut them in half and remove any white tissue in the center; dice into chunky pieces.</li>
    <li>Heat butter or lard in large pot over medium heat. Add diced kidney and steak; cook and stir until beef is browned. Stir in onions and season with salt. Worcesterhire sauce, pepper, thyme and bay leaf. Stir in 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups water; simmer until the heat is almost tender, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Add potatoes and continue simmering until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Whisk remaining <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup water and flour together until smooth; stir into beef mixture. Continue cooking and stirring until mixture thickens; transfer into a 3-quart casserole dish.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Roll out pastry slightly larger than to of casserole dish; place pastry over meat mixture and trim to leave a 1-inch overhang on all sides. Fold under and flute against inside edge of casserole, then cut several slits in the crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
    <li>Bake pie in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and filling is bubbling about 30mins.</li>
